I am a quant finance professional working in NYC.  I have spent my entire career working in the equity markets.  My main programming languages are R and SQL.  

I have a deep love of learning and enjoy figuring out how things work, be it the stock market, plumbing systems, electrical systems, or cars.  I enjoy using my Rasberry Pi for home automation projects.

You can reach me at roger dot bos at gmail dot com.

This entire website was built in R using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. Thanks Yihui Xie!
